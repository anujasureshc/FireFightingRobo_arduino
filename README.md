#  Fire Fighting Robot

An autonomous fire-fighting robot built using Arduino technology. This bot is designed to detect and extinguish fires efficiently using flame and smoke sensors, combined with a servo-operated water pump mechanism.

##  Abstract

The Fire Fighting Robot offers a compact and intelligent solution to detect and suppress small-scale fires. Using an **Arduino Uno** as the control hub, the robot processes data from multiple flame sensors and an MQ2 smoke sensor for 360¬∞ fire detection. A servo motor aims the water pump, which is triggered via a relay module to extinguish detected flames. The bot's movement is powered by **DC motors** controlled through an **L293D motor driver**, and it is energized by **18650 batteries**, making it portable and suitable for fire-prone zones and hazardous environments.
